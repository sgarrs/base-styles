            <h2 class='chapter__title'>Considering The Utility Of Blue&nbsp;Snowpants</h2>
            <p class='chapter__paragraph'>Susan Falls thinks Carla Ribisi has a big ass and that Carla Ribisi&rsquo;s big ass is beautiful and that Carla does not know it. And Carla Ribisi is always wearing blue nylon snowpants. The intended effect of the snow&shy;pants is to disguise the big&shy;ness of the ass in bigger&shy;ness, Susan Falls thinks. It is a com&shy;plicated trick. It begins with a syllogism. The first premise is that anyone who wears snow&shy;pants appears to have a big ass:</p>
            <ol class='chapter__list'>
                <li>1. Anyone who wears snow&shy;pants appears to have a big ass.</li>
                <li>2. Carla Ribisi wears snow&shy;pants.</li>
                <li>:: Carla Ribisi appears to have a big ass.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class='chapter__paragraph'>The trick comes of the word <em>appears</em>. <em>Appears</em> allows for, but does not necess&shy;itate, visual trick&shy;ery. Things that allow for but do not necess&shy;itate other things are tricky, and tricky things engender consider&shy;ation. Things that allow for but do not necess&shy;itate trickery itself are even trickier, and those things engender much richer consider&shy;ation. The richer the consider&shy;ation en&shy;gender&shy;ed by a thing, the longer the time one will spend consider&shy;ing that thing. Consider the follow&shy;ing hypo&shy;thetical situation:</p>
            <div class='chapter__section--indented'>
                <p class='chapter__paragraph'>Susan Falls has just started dating Carla Ribisi, and the two go shop&shy;ping together for what will soon become another item of Carla Ribisi&rsquo;s laund&shy;ry. A new T-shirt, for instance. They go into the changing room together, and Carla tries on one of the two low-cut V-neck stretchy T-shirts she&rsquo;s thinking about buying, say a red one, a warm red, like that of the hair under Susan&rsquo;s arms. The T-shirt looks good and Susan Falls tells Carla Ribisi that the T-shirt looks good.</p>
                <p class='chapter__paragraph'>Carla tells Susan Falls that this is the first time she&rsquo;s shared a chang&shy;ing room with another woman since the long-lost days when she used to shop at indoor malls with her mother. Susan Falls blushes. Carla Ribisi removes T-shirt #1, and, reach&shy;ing for T-shirt&thinsp;#2, looks at Susan Falls, long&shy;ing&shy;ly (?), and says, &ldquo;Blush&shy;er.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph">Being called on blush&shy;ing causes dollar-coin-size spots of the same shade of blush as Susan Falls&rsquo;s face to appear on Susan Falls&rsquo;s neck.</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph">Carla Ribisi pulls her head up through T-shirt&thinsp;#2. &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she says to Susan Falls, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you embarrassed when I said that you were a blush&shy;er.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph">The dollar coins darken in time with Susan&rsquo;s ecstasy.</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph">Susan&rsquo;s ecstasy is like neither a balloon nor a hat&shy;pin, but like a hat&shy;pin&rsquo;s entrance and move&shy;ment, under guidance of a cotton-gloved birth&shy;day clown, through the skin of a balloon.</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph">There is something that is so god&shy;damned hot about Carla Ribisi consider&shy;ing and, further, discuss&shy;ing any effect which she has had on Susan Falls. Let alone in a Nordstrom dress&shy;ing room, trying on T-shirts.</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph">T-shirt&thinsp;#2 looks good, but in a differ&shy;ent way than the way in which T-shirt #1 looks good.</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph chapter__paragraph--dialog">&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Carla wants to know.</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph chapter__paragraph--dialog">&ldquo;It looks good,&rdquo; Susan says. &ldquo;It makes your tits look bigger.&rdquo;</p>
                <p class="chapter__paragraph chapter__paragraph--dialog">&ldquo;Hmm.&rdquo; Carla doesn&rsquo;t know if she likes that. She has big-enough-looking tits already. Showing them off, she has decided at different times in her past, makes her look like a floozy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;That it makes my tits look bigger?&rdquo;</p>
